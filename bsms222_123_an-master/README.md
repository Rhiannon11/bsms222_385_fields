### Tutorials

- **[Explore SCN2A mutations collected from Sanders et al 2018](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/blob/master/analyze_scn2a_mutations.nb.html) ([raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/master/analyze_scn2a_mutations.Rmd)).** This is a tutorial for autodidact who just finished the Rafa book's chapter 3 and 4.  

- **[Gene annotations for the human genome](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/blob/master/analyze_gencode.nb.html) ([raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/master/analyze_gencode.Rmd)).** This is a tutorial for the chapter 5, `tidyverse`. Here we access to the GENCODE database for the human gene annotation and deal with many cases in data munging for gene and transcript information. It would be a welcoming kit for modern biologists. 

- **[TCGA lung cancers](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/blob/master/analyze_TCGA.nb.html) ([raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joonan30/bsms222_123_an/master/analyze_TCGA.Rmd)).** This is a tutorial for the chapter 7 and 8, `ggplot`. Here we will describe sample information from the TCGA lung cancer, and learn how to visualize your analytics using ggplot2 functions.

- **Gene expression in developing human brains.** How many genes are expressed in human brains? Which genes are specifically expressed in fetal brains? what is the distribution of gene expression across developmental stages? We will analyze the gene expression data from the BrainSpan database. With this dataset, we will apply various techniques for data visualisation discussed in the chapter 7 - 12.

- **Analysis of genetic variants from general population.** This will be an assignment for students and draw their own plots from the dataset followed by peer review.
